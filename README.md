# SOLID : Open Closed Principle

Forked from xke-solid https://github.com/xebia-france/xke-solid

# Why?
```java
public void clean() {
  for (int i = 0 ; i < program.length() ; i++) {
    switch (program.charAt(i)) {
      case('A'):
        goForward();
        break;
      case('D'):
        turnRight();
        break;
      case('G'):
        turnLeft();
        break;
      default:
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid command: " + program.charAt(i));
    }
  }
}
```
When adding a new command changes multiple classes like adding one new `Command` and updating the already created class `Hoover`, the class which runs the program, you should stop and think.

# Definition :
> Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification

Which means: keep as much as possible existing code unchanged when adding new functionality.

# How?
Most of the use cases involves inheritance and polymorphism but you can also use patterns like Decorator, Factory or Observer.
